To start, let's take a quick spin on Rocket's featureset, and see how everything
looks together in practice.

## Launching Rocket

<Steps>
1.  Under the ribbon bar, open the "Plugins" tab
2.  Locate the Rocket toolbar, which looks like this
	(note the Launch and Settings buttons):

3.  Inside that toolbar, click on the "Launch" button
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
	Rocket has many, many keybinds, so you don't have to constantly
	open the Plugins tab. Keybinds are covered later.
